# 🧠 Issue Board – React Engineering Assessment

Welcome! This is a React case study designed to assess your skills in frontend architecture, state management, component design, and algorithmic
thinking.

You’ll build a **Kanban-style issue board** with interactive functionality, sorting logic, and user access control — similar to a simplified Jira or
GitHub Projects board.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **React application** that lets users:

- View, search, and filter a list of issues
- Drag and drop issues between columns
- Automatically **sort issues** using a custom priority score
- **Undo** issue updates with rollback behavior
- Track and display **recently accessed issues**
- Apply **role-based permissions**
- Handle real-time updates (via polling or simulated sockets)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Router
- Mock API via JSON
- LocalStorage
- (Optional) Drag & Drop: `@dnd-kit/core` or equivalent
